## geobasins

Routines for hydrologic analysis of river watersheds using standard GIS and numerical routines.

Project purpose: develop routines for automatic watershed delimitation, morphometric analysis and hydrological design using event-based or continuous hydrological modelling.

The project consist of the following parts (in progress): 

1) Simple climate data access and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) download. 
2) Data preprocess and computation of DEM-derived rasters/vectors.
3) Automatic basin delimitation based on georeferenced points.
4) Postprocess of basin geomorphological properties and creation of basin property tables. 
5) Hydrological modelling based on basin property tables along with event-based
or continuous lumped models.
